            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I did my undergraduate studies at <em>Queen’s University</em> where I got my first taste of GIS. I began to take courses to obtain a certificate in GIS along with my physical geography bachelors degree. I graduated in 2025 and that same year began my graduate studies at <em>Fanshawe College</em> to obtain a graduate certificate in GIS and begin to look for practical GIS work. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Implementing GIS solutions to real world applications has been a core part of my studies, and the managing and operation of the data to solve specific geographic problems is something I’ve come to excel at. The use of spatial analysis techniques along with multi-criteria decision analysis and suitability modelling are key GIS topics of which I have utilized on both urban and environmental applications.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I spent my final year of undergraduate studies as the GIS Liaison for the geography student council, where I held weekly GIS help sessions for first and second year students. As well, I had my project on determining a suitable location for a new nuclear power plant in Ontario published in the undergraduate geography journal (GEN V Journal). My current goals are to better integrate my programming skills into my work, and complete one freelance GIS project per month.</p>
